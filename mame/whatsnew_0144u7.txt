Source Changes
--------------
Rewrote tilemap.c as a C++ class. For now kept the global functions
and just inline mapped them to the class. Will do a pass soon to
actually update drivers to use the C++ methods directly. Also, the
tilemap callbacks are now delegates which should make for cleaner
integrating into modern devices and drivers going forward. 
[Aaron Giles]

Add libjpeg; converted Sliver to decompress pictures on the fly
[David Haywood, R. Belmont]

Remove support for 4bpp packed graphics. These only manifested for
drivers that used GFX_RAW support for 4bpp systems, and yet we had a
bunch of extra code to support it. Updated these drivers to do without
it and removed all the extra code for supporting it. [Aaron Giles]

tagmap is just a C++ template now. Added iterators to it as well.
Updated a few outlying uses. [Aaron Giles]

bunch of kludges [Angelo Salese]

i386: Made stack limit checks better handle the difference between 16
and 32-bit stacks in IRET and RETF. [Barry Rodewald]

Rodewald]

[Roberto Fresca]

Move devices into a proper hierarchy and handle naming and paths
consistently for devices, I/O ports, memory regions, memory banks, and
memory shares. [Aaron Giles]

Robo to use deco generic sprite device [David Haywood]
